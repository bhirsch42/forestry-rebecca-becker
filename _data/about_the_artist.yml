about_the_artist: "Rebecca Becker, an Atlanta Artist, is the mother of two school-age children. After graduating from the University of Virginia, she pursued a career in advertising and marketing. After taking some time off to be a full-time mom, she returned to her passion for portraiture. As long as she can remember, she has been interested in faces and figure drawing. In addition to figure drawing classes, she studied oil painting under renowned Atlanta artist Donna Cassaro Hughes.  She has now expanded to abstracts and landscapes. Those available for sale are noted with a price."
portrait_process: "Rebecca works from life and photographs. After a consultation regarding medium, portrait size and attire, she will take several photographs on location. After the client agrees on the photograph, she will return to her studio to complete the portrait. One third of the portrait fee is due when the photographs are taken. The balance is due upon satisfactory delivery of the portrait. Rebecca will work to the best of her ability to make sure the client is completely satisfied with the final portrait."
